When I run nodemon ./Student.js and then make changes to the code 
(like modifying the text in writeFileSync) and save the file, here's what happens:

Nodemon detects the change immediately and shows a message like:
[nodemon] restarting due to changes...

It automatically restarts the program, so I don’t have to stop and run it again manually.

The updated code runs, so if I changed the text in hello.txt, the new version gets written and printed in the terminal.

If there’s an error (like a typo), Nodemon shows it right away, so I can fix it and save again.

What I noticed:

The terminal updates super fast after I save.

The hello.txt file gets overwritten every time (because writeFileSync runs again).

It’s way easier than running node ./Student.js over and over!
